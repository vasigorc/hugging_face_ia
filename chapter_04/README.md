# Chapter 4. Using Hugging Face for Computer Vision Tasks

The computer vision models hosted on Hugging Face are grouped into the following tasks:

- Object Detection
- Image Classification
- Image Segmentation
- Video Classification
- Depth Estimation
- Image-to-Image
- Unconditional Image Generation
- Zero-Shot Image Classification

## Object Detection

> The primary goal of object detection is to not only classify the objects in the image
> or video but also to determine their precise positions by drawing bounding boxes around them.
