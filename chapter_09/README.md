# Chapter 9. Programming agents

This chapter introduces the concept of programming agents, focusing on how AI agents can understand, reason, act and respond
to real-world tasks. The author highlights that while specialized models are effective for well-defined tasks, managing
ambiguous, multi step, or dynamic tasks becomes challenging. Agents address this by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
to reason, plan, and delegate tasks, breaking down complex problems into smaller subtasks and using appropriate tools or
models. Agents are able to simplify complex workflows. In this chapter the author sets the stage for building intelligent
agents that can manage state, memory, and tool selection in multi step reasoning pipelines.
